Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory analysis, data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and dashboard creation.
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using industry-relevant tools and practices.

Dataset

The dataset was loaded using Python

Contains structured data suitable for analysis and visualization

Initial data included missing values, inconsistencies, and redundant records which were handled during cleaning

(Dataset source can be added here if applicable)

Tools & Technologies

Python (for data loading, EDA, and cleaning)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for analysis and visualization)

MySQL (for writing and executing SQL queries)

Power BI (for building interactive dashboards)

Project Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data structure, distributions, and relationships

Identified missing values and outliers

Data Cleaning

Handled missing and duplicate values

Corrected data types and standardized formats

Prepared clean data for analysis and reporting

SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Imported cleaned data into MySQL

Executed SQL queries to extract key metrics and insights

Used filtering, grouping, joins, and aggregations

Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to the processed data

Built interactive dashboards with KPIs and visual insights

Dashboards

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Trend analysis and comparisons

Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Clear visual storytelling for business decision-making
